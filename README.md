# Image-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning-with-VGG16-
Implementing transfer learning with VGG16 for image classification. Fine-tuning pre-trained model on a small dataset, enhancing with data augmentation. Demonstrates adapting deep learning models to specific tasks efficiently.

This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of transfer learning for image classification using the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture. Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets, such as ImageNet, and fine-tuning them on specific tasks with smaller datasets.

The VGG16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is utilized as a feature extractor, where the learned representations from its convolutional layers are employed to classify images into predefined categories. By freezing certain layers of the VGG16 model and fine-tuning others, the project showcases the flexibility and effectiveness of transfer learning in adapting a pre-trained model to new classification tasks.

Key components of the project include:

Loading the pre-trained VGG16 model and understanding its architecture.
Freezing certain layers of the VGG16 model to prevent their weights from being updated during training.
Adding custom fully connected layers on top of the VGG16 base to perform classification.
Data augmentation techniques applied to the training dataset to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.
Training the model using a small dataset while monitoring performance on a separate validation set.
Evaluating the trained model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
Saving the trained model for future use or deployment in real-world applications.
By following this project, users can gain insights into the practical implementation of transfer learning for image classification tasks and understand the workflow involved in adapting a pre-trained convolutional neural network to specific domain tasks with limited data.

Explanation of each section:

1-Import TensorFlow: This imports the TensorFlow library, which is used for building and training neural networks.
2-Loading VGG16 Model: Here, the VGG16 model is loaded from the tensorflow.keras.applications module. We specify that we want to load the model with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset and exclude the fully connected layers (include_top=False). We also define the input shape for the model.
3-Displaying Convolutional Layers: The summary() method is called on the VGG16 model to display its architecture, including all layers and their parameters.
Freezing Layers: We freeze layers in the VGG16 model up to a certain point (block5_conv1) to prevent them from being updated during training.
5-Creating the Model: An empty sequential model is created using Keras.
6-Adding VGG16 as Convolutional Layer: We add the VGG16 model as a convolutional layer to our sequential model.
7-Flattening Layers: The output of the VGG16 model is flattened into a one-dimensional array.
8-Adding Neural Layers: Two dense layers are added to the model for classification. The first dense layer has 256 units and ReLU activation, while the second dense layer has 5 units with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
9-Model Compilation: The model is compiled with a binary cross-entropy loss function, RMSprop optimizer with a specified learning rate, and accuracy metric.
10-Displaying the Model Summary: The summary of the complete model architecture is displayed.
11-Data Preparation: Directories containing training, validation, and test data are defined. Data augmentation is applied to the training data using ImageDataGenerator to prevent overfitting.
12-Training Data Generator: Training data is generated in batches using flow_from_directory.
13-Validation Data Generator: Validation data is generated in batches using flow_from_directory.
14-Training the Model: The model is trained using the fit method. Training data, validation data, number of training steps, and epochs are specified.
15-Saving the Model: The trained model is saved to the working directory with the specified name.
16-Testing Data Generator: Test data is generated in batches using flow_from_directory.
17-Evaluating the Model: The model is evaluated on the test data using the evaluate method, and test accuracy is printed.
