# Image Classification using Transfer Learning with VGG16

This repository contains code for implementing transfer learning with the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture for image classification tasks. Transfer learning is a technique that involves utilizing pre-trained models on large datasets, such as ImageNet, and fine-tuning them on specific tasks with smaller datasets.

## Overview

The project demonstrates how to adapt a pre-trained VGG16 model for image classification tasks efficiently. It involves fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a small dataset and enhancing it with data augmentation techniques to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

### Key Components

1. **Loading Pre-trained VGG16 Model**: The VGG16 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, is loaded and its architecture is understood.
2. **Freezing Layers**: Certain layers of the VGG16 model are frozen to prevent their weights from being updated during training.
3. **Creating the Model**: Custom fully connected layers are added on top of the VGG16 base for classification.
4. **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like data augmentation are applied to the training dataset to improve model generalization.
5. **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on separate validation and test datasets.
6. **Saving the Model**: The trained model is saved for future use or deployment.
